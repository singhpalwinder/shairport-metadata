# ðŸŽµ Shairport Metadata to Matrix Dashboard Broadcaster

This Python 3 project runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and listens to [Shairport-Sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync) metadata output in real-time to extract and decode album artwork during AirPlay streaming. It then processes the image and sends it directly to a C++-based LED matrix dashboard running on an [Adafruit Matrix Portal S3](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5800).

> ðŸš€ This project **broadcasts artwork to**:  
> ðŸ‘‰ [`matrix-dashboard`](https://github.com/singhpalwinder/matrix-dashboard) â€” a C++ LED dashboard running on the Matrix Portal S3

## ðŸ“¸ What It Does

- **Listens to AirPlay metadata** using `shairport-sync` via a Unix named pipe.
- **Processes album artwork**:
  - Decodes base64-encoded image data.
  - Resizes image to 32Ã—32 pixels.
  - Converts it to RGB565 byte stream.
- **Sends artwork** to the Matrix Dashboard running C++ on the Matrix Portal S3 via TCP on port `9090`.
- **Extracts dominant colors** using K-Means clustering and adjusts Zigbee-based smart lighting (via Home Assistant) to match the media's vibe.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. `shairport-sync` writes now-playing metadata to `/tmp/shairport-sync-metadata`.
2. This script parses the stream, looking for:
   - `core/asal` â†’ album name
   - `ssnc/PICT` â†’ embedded album artwork
   - `ssnc/pbeg`/`prsm`/`prgr` â†’ playback events
3. Once a new image is detected:
   - It's decoded and hashed to detect uniqueness
   - Saved to disk
   - Sent as raw RGB565 byte data over TCP to the Matrix Portal S3 (`matrix.lan:9090`)
4. The Matrix Portal S3 C++ code receives and displays the image instantly.
5. A K-Means color analysis selects the best ambient color for the room.
6. Zigbee2MQTT + Home Assistant is used to update lighting based on dominant color tones.
